learn about taking in another class as a parameter
and that const attribute cannot be modified AT ALL
as it can only be initialized by constructor(s)
which will affect the copy constructor and copy assingment operator

also note that we use private and not protected for Forms' attribute
if form is private only From class can modify the attribute
if protected, both From and concrete class can modify Form's attribute

but currenttly we have Burea & Form class
that is why Bure is unable to modify the bool _signed
also because we were explicited told that 
From changes the value
&
Burea only checks the status
